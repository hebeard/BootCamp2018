I spent most of my hours this week learning the syntax and rules behind OpenMP and MPI, as well as doing the Math problem set. 
By the time the weekend came, I had not started the economics homework, and I barely scratched the surface on the computation 
homework. Over the weekend, I had to visit my mother and host a family friend for a couple nights, so I did not have time to 
work on my assignments that much. I worked as hard as I could Sunday night. Yesterday, I was planning on spending all day to 
crank out my assignments, but I had to take care of financial aid and family auto insurance paperwork that I needed completed 
by today. As a result of all of this, I requested (and was granted) an extension for my Comp and Econ problem sets. I submitted 
my economics problem set already. However, as per Rick's advice, I have decided to "cut my losses" with regards to this week's 
Comp problem set. I am far too behind to make reasonable progress on it while still keeping up with the problem sets for this 
new week. I apologize for this fiasco and my lack of assignment this week. The HPC and parallelization content was fascinating;
I simply did not have the time to finish it all. 

Thank you for your understanding.
