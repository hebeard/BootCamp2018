I was away all weekend visiting my family and hosting a guest from afar in my home, so I did not have time to do any homework. I was already very much behind last week, so please allow me a bit of extra time in submitting my economics and computation problem sets this week. I intend to upload economics in its entirety by Tuesday night, and computation on Wednesday night. Both will be pushed to my git repo.

Thank you so much for understanding,
Harrison Beard
