This week's DSGE, Linearization, and Perturbation problem sets were exceedingly difficult and time-consuming, even after ample help and support from my peers. I simply did not have enough time at the end of the week to completely finish debugging all my code, especially for the Linearization exercises, and my morale steadily plummeted as the week went on. In the end, I believe I put in a good effort and made a lot of gains from trade through collaboration. I'm quite happy with the DSGE section and most of the Perturbation section.

For future iterations of OSM, I suggest that these exercises would be better suited to cover a two- or three-week span, rather than one week. Very few students I spoke to seemed to understand what to do.
